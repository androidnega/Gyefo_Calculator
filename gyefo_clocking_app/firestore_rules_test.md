# Firestore Security Rules Test Cases

## Test Setup

### Sample Users
```javascript
// Worker User
{
  uid: "worker123",
  data: {
    role: "worker",
    companyId: "company1",
    teamId: "team1",
    email: "worker@company1.com"
  }
}

// Manager User  
{
  uid: "manager456", 
  data: {
    role: "manager",
    companyId: "company1",
    teamId: "team1", 
    email: "manager@company1.com"
  }
}

// External User (Different Company)
{
  uid: "external789",
  data: {
    role: "worker", 
    companyId: "company2",
    teamId: "team2",
    email: "worker@company2.com" 
  }
}
```

## Test Cases

      clockIn: timestamp,
      clockOut: timestamp
    }
  },
  request: {
    auth: { uid: "worker123" }
  }
})
```

      companyId: "company1",

      data: {
        userId: "worker123",
        companyId: "company1",
        attendanceId: "attendance123",
        reason: "Traffic jam",
        status: "pending"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### ❌ Worker cannot create justification for others

// FAIL: Worker tries to create justification for another user
match("/justifications/just456", {
  request: {
    auth: { uid: "worker123" },
    resource: {
      data: {
        userId: "worker999",
        companyId: "company1", 
        attendanceId: "attendance456",
        reason: "Medical appointment",
        status: "pending"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### ✅ Manager can approve justifications
```javascript
// PASS: Manager updates justification status
match("/justifications/just123", {
  resource: {
    data: {
      userId: "worker123",
      companyId: "company1",
      status: "pending"
    }
  },
  request: {
    auth: { uid: "manager456" },
    resource: {
      data: {
        userId: "worker123", 
        companyId: "company1",
        status: "approved",
        managerNote: "Approved - valid reason"
      }
    }

      data: {
        name: "Development Team",
        companyId: "company1",
        managerId: "manager456"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### ❌ Worker cannot create teams

        companyId: "company1"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### ✅ Worker can read shifts
```javascript
// PASS: Worker reads shift schedule
match("/shifts/shift123", {
  resource: {
    data: {
      name: "Morning Shift",
      companyId: "company1",
      startTime: "09:00",
      endTime: "17:00"
    }
  },
  request: {
    auth: { uid: "worker123" }
  }
})
```

### 4. Cross-Company Security Tests

#### ❌ No access to different company data
```javascript
// FAIL: User from company1 accessing company2 data
match("/users/external789", {
  resource: {
    data: {
      role: "worker",
      companyId: "company2"
    }
  },
  request: {
    auth: { uid: "worker123" } // company1 user
  }
})
```

## Running Tests

To test these rules:

1. **Firebase Emulator Suite:**
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start --only firestore
   ```

2. **Rules Playground:**
   - Open Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules tab
   - Use the Rules Playground to simulate requests

3. **Unit Tests:**
   ```javascript
   // Using @firebase/rules-unit-testing
   const { assertFails, assertSucceeds } = require('@firebase/rules-unit-testing');
   
   it('allows worker to read own attendance', async () => {
     const db = testEnv.authenticatedContext('worker123').firestore();
     const doc = db.doc('attendance/attendance123');
     await assertSucceeds(doc.get());
   });
   
   it('denies worker reading other attendance', async () => {
     const db = testEnv.authenticatedContext('worker123').firestore();
     const doc = db.doc('attendance/attendance456');  
     await assertFails(doc.get());
   });
   ```

## Security Summary

The updated Firestore rules provide:

✅ **Role-based Access Control:** Workers and Managers have distinct permissions
✅ **Company Isolation:** Users can only access data from their company
✅ **Self-Service:** Workers can manage their own data (attendance, justifications)
✅ **Manager Oversight:** Managers can access and approve worker data
✅ **Write Protection:** Critical collections (teams, shifts) are manager-only
✅ **Audit Trail:** All operations are properly logged and traceable

The rules are now production-ready with comprehensive security coverage.
